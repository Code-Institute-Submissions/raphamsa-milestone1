# UX

**Dynamic Fitness Gym** would like to have a website mainly to keep their customers informed of changes on classes timetables and to get new customers.
When a user accesses the website, he will be able to check which classes are available on a weekly basis. 

The user will be able to contact the gym for further queries using the contact form. The gallery section containing images and video will show how the gym facilities look inside. The types of modalities can be found on both home page and activities page.
The Free Trial Pass button on the callout section gives the company an opportunity to attract new customers to visit the gym facilities.
